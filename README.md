# Genrefy
Small app that visualizes genres with a pie chart and shows you a layout of images of your top artists/songs. 

Tech stack used:
- React
- TypeScript
- ChartJS
- React Query

Currently only in development mode. I've sent a request to Spotify to extend the quota and make it available without assigning users manually in Spotify dashboard.
